## Machine Learning Workflow for Energy Usage Prediction

### 1. **Data Preparation**
- **Export Data**: 
  - Export the energy usage data from the DynamoDB table, containing `date` and `usage` columns.
- **Preprocess Data**: 
  - Clean the data by handling missing values.
  - Convert the data into a suitable format (e.g., CSV) for model training.
- **Split Data**: 
  - Divide the preprocessed data into training and testing datasets.

---

### 2. **Upload Data to S3**
- **Create/Use S3 Bucket**:
  - Create a new Amazon S3 bucket or use an existing one to store the processed data.
- **Upload Datasets**:
  - Upload the training and testing datasets to the designated S3 bucket.

---

### 3. **Set up SageMaker Notebook**
- **Navigate to SageMaker**:
  - Open the AWS Management Console and go to the SageMaker service.
- **Set up Notebook**:
  - Create a new SageMaker notebook instance or use an existing one.
  - Access the Jupyter notebook interface.

---

### 4. **Data Exploration and Feature Engineering**
- **Load Data**:
  - Load the training dataset from the S3 bucket using the AWS SDK (`boto3`) or an S3 URL.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
  - Analyze the `date` and `usage` columns for patterns and trends.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Generate new features from the `date` column, such as:
    - Day of the week
    - Month
    - Season
  - These features help capture temporal patterns in energy usage.

### 5. **Model Training**
- **Select Algorithm**:
  - Choose a time series forecasting algorithm, such as:
    - ARIMA
    - Prophet
    - DeepAR
  - Use SageMaker's built-in algorithms or a custom algorithm in TensorFlow/PyTorch.
- **Define Model**:
  - Set up the model architecture and specify the hyperparameters.
  - Define training parameters.
- **Train Model**:
  - Train the model on the training dataset.
  - Evaluate performance on the validation data.
- **Fine-Tune**:
  - Adjust hyperparameters to optimize performance.

---

### 6. **Model Evaluation**
- **Make Predictions**:
  - Use the trained model to predict energy usage on the testing dataset.
- **Evaluate Performance**:
  - Calculate metrics such as:
    - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- **Visualization**:
  - Plot predicted vs. actual energy usage values to assess accuracy.

---

### 7. **Model Deployment**
- **Deploy Model**:
  - Use SageMaker hosting services to deploy the trained model.
  - Create an endpoint and configure resources (e.g., instance type, auto-scaling).
- **Test Endpoint**:
  - Verify that the endpoint is working correctly.

---

### 8. **Integration with Application**
- **Update Backend**:
  - Modify the backend to make HTTP requests to the SageMaker endpoint to retrieve predictions.
- **Update Frontend**:
  - Enhance the frontend to display predicted energy usage alongside actual values.
- **Testing**:
  - Test the integration to ensure predictions are displayed correctly.

---

### 9. **Monitoring and Retraining**
- **Monitor Performance**:
  - Use AWS CloudWatch to track the deployed model's performance and detect anomalies.
- **Retraining Pipeline**:
  - Collect new energy usage data and store it in the S3 bucket.
  - Schedule periodic retraining of the model with updated data.
- **Update Model**:
  - Replace the deployed model with the retrained version to maintain prediction accuracy.
